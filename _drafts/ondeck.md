## How to do things if you're not that smart and don't have any talent 

Doesn't the title say it all? Lots of good lessons in here, you just have to deal with clicking on the link and wondering what that means about your self perception.

## Adopting the becquerel for network requests

This author says that the most suitable SI unit for network request rates is the becquerel (Bq), a unit of radioactive decay. I can't say I'm passionate to take up this mantle but the argument that we should have a _general_ SI unit for the rate of non-periodic events is interesting.

## Scalene

A CPU/GPU/memory profiler for Python code, with an optional (opt-in) OpenAI powered "AI-optimization suggestions" feature. The reviews seem really positive, and the README includes some benchmarks comparing it against other profilers. I haven't used it yet but I'll give it a whirl next time I need to find a weak spot in my work!
