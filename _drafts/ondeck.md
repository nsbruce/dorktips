## Avoid programming anything to do with time

One of the first pieces of advice (related to software development) I read online was that if you're asked to write a calendar or scheduling tool, or anything in that vein, to quit your job immediately and run screaming in the other direction. I've since read a number of articles talking about the many edge-cases that appear when dealing with times and dates in software and this one is quite a good one. It lists 34 misconceptions that the author had about timezones. My personal favourite punchlines (not misconceptions) are:

1. there are more timezones than countries, and
2. Amsterdam was once offset from UTC by 19 minutes and 32.13 seconds.
