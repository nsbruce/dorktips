## Are new users the problem with software?

This article asks the question "why do applications seem _worse_ than they used to?". The author argues that since user-base growth is a common metric for the success of an app, companies are incentivized only to keep drawing in new users rather than focusing on existing users. To draw in new users, they simplify the app, generally creating a worse experience for existing users. The author points to websites like Reddit and Craigslist for counter-examples. Neither has changed (meaningfully) in years yet enjoy continuing popularity.
