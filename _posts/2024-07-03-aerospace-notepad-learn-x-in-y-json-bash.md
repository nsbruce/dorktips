## AeroSpace 

I've been planning to do a piece on Dorktips for some time about "my stack", where I'll step through the components of my development environment. I use a tiling window manager and since transitioning to it have found stacking window managers (like Windows, GNOME, KDE, macOS, etc) pretty limiting. This is a project that I haven't tried yet which emulates a proper tiling window manager on macOS. The [1:31 long Youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOl7ErqWbrk) makes it look pretty good!

## Notepad Tab

This simple note-taking tool/website works without a server. You type into the box, and the content is encoded into the URL. So you can copy and paste the URL and it will decode into the original content. Very slick idea which they say was inspired by a similarly featured [Mermaid editor](https://mermaid.live).

## Learn X in Y minutes

This website offers crowd-sourced rapid intros to programming languages. Fun for quickly exploring a language you've been curious about!

## json.bash

This tool generates JSON using a CLI tool. This makes it easy to pipe things like environment variables into json files without fiddling with JSON syntax by hand. Following the UNIX philosophy that each program should do one thing well, json.bash states:

> `json.bash`'s one thing is to get shell-native data (environment variables, files, program output) to somewhere else, using JSON encapsulate it robustly.

I particularly appreciate that the authors so explicitly outline their "one thing".
