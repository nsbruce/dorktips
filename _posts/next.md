## SVG tutorial

Vector graphics are cool! I do a lot of work using LaTeX/TikZ for vector graphics but in the web and for a more modern experience, SVG exists. This tutorial is a really friendly intro with lots of clickable examples and good explanations of high-level elements.

## OpenCLI

Following in the footsteps of the popular OpenAPI, this effort to provide a standard for interfacing with CLI applications is interesting. It's still very much in an "alpha" stage of development but the idea is appealing. As somebody who spends a lot of time working with CLI tools, it's easy to imagine the utility of having standard interfaces for making things like automation easier.
