## Open source maintainer manifesto

This is a manifesto that one OSS maintainer has written in an attempt to head off questions like "Is this project still maintained?". It's obviously not suitable for every project but it's a funny read with a basic stance of "I don't owe you anything, but you're welcome to hack on it yourself in a fork".

## Visual design rules

This is not a cheer from a visual design pep rally, it's just a list of rules one can follow to make visuals attractive. This one has an example for each and I found a careful read-through enlightening. I've always been interested in visual design but have never felt particularly gifted at it. I'm a big fan of trying to offset that lack of artistic gift with well-studied skill.

## Open source is neither community now democracy

This shares a similar vein as the above manifesto. The primary argument here is that open source is a tool for collaboration, not a policy for decision-making.
